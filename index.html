          <h2>Who am i ?</h2>
          <p>
            I'm Igor Fabris. I am located in Berlin. For 35 years I worked in
            the entertainment industry in the field of graphic design, audio and
            video production. I have been awarded many times for my work at the
            world level. I decided to change my profession during the Covid
            situation when my industry lost its job completely. As a former
            programmer (20 years and more ago) I decided to dive into water
            programmers again and now Iâ€™m here. In addition to Web pages, I also
            produce content that should appear on them. I have extensive
            experience in the production of audio and video content and graphic
            design. As a former owner of one of the largest multimedia companies
            in Croatia, I gained extensive experience in teamwork and learned
            how to be part of a good team. I am a good collaborator but I have
            my own opinion and knowledge that supports it. I always follow the
            latest trends and try to be up-to-date with everything that is
            happening in the industry. I am available at work 0-24 24/7 if
            needed. I am a big fan of books in any form. I spend my free time
            with my family, I walk at least 15 km every day or I go on long bike
            rides.
          </p>
          <h2>Why to hire me ?</h2>
          <p>
            It's simple. I am a one stop solution for web design and website
            programming including audio and video content. Give me an idea or a
            vision and sleep well. The rest is on me. Fast and accurate
            communication, problem-solving ability and more. I am also a video
            editor, 3D composer and audio engineer. I prefer remote work and
            freelancing, but I know how to be part of a team. Impossible does
            not exist in my dictionary ...
